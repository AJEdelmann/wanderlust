This project helped me to build fluency in JavaScript Requests because I could practice making API calls in JavaScript. 
For this project I used jQuery and asynchronous functions in order to fetch data from foursquare and openweather api's.

### Why I recommend this project? 
Making requests and working with real data is something we encounter on almost any project.
